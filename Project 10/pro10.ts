/*================ COMMENTING DURING CODE ==========================

//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written,
// and add at least one comment to each.
// If you don’t have anything specific 
//to write because your programs are too simple at this point,
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
//Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
