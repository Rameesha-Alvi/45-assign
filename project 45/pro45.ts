//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
//such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
